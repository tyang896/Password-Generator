# Password Generator

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a web application that generates a random password according to a user's preference. This application helps solve issues with user's that need help coming up with new passwords.

In this project I've learned how javascript works together with html and css to create a more interactive user experience. I've learned how to create functions in javascript and how to create conditional statements to return the outcome that I want.
